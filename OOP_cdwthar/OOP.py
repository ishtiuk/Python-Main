#   OOP means Object Oriented Progrmming, that means Objects will be the core-part of a specific program which uses the 'OOP'.

# In OOP, logics will be resolve or spin by based on significant Objects.

#  OOP follows the 'DRY' law, full form : Don't have to Relpy Yourself' .

# that means you do not need to declare or reply or define characteristics or attriubtes in every Objects, cause 'class' contains the attributes or characteristics,
# so, you can define Attributes or characteristics for an Object by just calling the 'class'
