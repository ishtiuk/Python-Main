# There are so many people around you. How do you identify them?
# you can identify them, according to there unique 'Attributes' or 'Characteristics', right? Because, every Human has his/her own uniqueness.
# they look different. Some are skinny. Some are healthier,
# and their skin color, hairstyle, face and names are different, Right?

# this means every person has distingusihable   'characteristics'. We all have distinguishable 'Attributes' or 'properties'.

# These are unique characteristics (attributes or properties) that differentiate one person from another. Right?

# This is True for 'Objects' as well. The shape, color , look and feel of a chair is different than a table. Similarly, a car has distinguishable characteristics than a house.



#               '''' Attributes ''''

# So every 'Object' or everything in the world has unique 'Attributes'.

#               '''' Works ;''''
# Other than attributes, most of the objects perform tasks as well, right??? For example, we eat, we walk, we sleep.

# A chair or table might not do many tasks. However, A car moves, She drinks petrol/ gasoline.

#           ' ''' That means...... ''''''
# This means every 'Object' in the universe--

# 1. Has unique 'attributes (characteristics).
# 2, May perform tasks and have their own different tasks. 
# Right?
