# Declaring a 'Class' is super easy. You have to do three things--

# 1. Use the keyword 'class'.
# 2. Give a name to your class. 
# 3. Use a colon sign " : ".

# annddddd,  that's all for declaring a 'class'.

# Example of Class:

class Phone:

# All the phones in the world have a brand name, it' the name of manufacturers.   Right..?

# You can say, every phone has an 'attributes' called brand. 

# 'attibutes' are just like variables that you declare inside a class. And you can give it an 'inital' value, hence you can change it after too.... 
# Don't forget to indent everything inside a 'class'.

#   Example of Class indentation.

class Phone:
    brand = "Samsung"

#  To create an Object from your Phone class. You will call the 'class' just like a function.

class Car:
    brand = "BMW"

my_car = Car()

# To see the 'attribute' in the Object you created you can print the 'attriubte' by typing the name of the Object and then give a dot sign " . " and then the name of that 'attribute' 

# Example to see the 'attribute' of created Object.

class AI:
    brand = 'HxD'
    manufacturer = 'Cyber Paradise'
    developer = 'CEO of HxD Corpo'

artificial_intelligence = AI()

print(artificial_intelligence.brand)
print(artificial_intelligence.manufacturer)
print(artificial_intelligence.developer)

# use the keyword 'class' to create a Class.
