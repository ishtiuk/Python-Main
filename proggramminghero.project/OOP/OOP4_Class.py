# all these times, I was talking about 'template'. Basically, 'template' is the 'Class'........!!!!!!    interesting.....!!

# Actually, the template has a better name, which is called the 'Class'.

# Now, you might ask, why it's called 'Class'.


#               Middle Class 
# Have you ever heard the term- "middle calss"? Similarly, you might hear. "Economy class" or "Business" while buying tickets. 

# Why are they called the class? Because they have a few similar attributes. 

#              School Class
# Even in a school, everyone in the same class has similar attributes. Like: all of them study the same subjects, they have the same teacher, and the are in a similar age group, same curriculum etc.
# that's why they are called class.

#           Similar Attibutes
# Hence, a 'class' is a category or a group of people/ things that share similar attributes. 

#           Usages of Class
# so, while programming, you will create a 'class' or the 'template'. However, we'll call this 'Class' from now. And then you will use the 'class' to create individual 'Objects' with similar attributes.

print('Quiz\n')
quiz1 = input('''What is a Class?
A. A school that has many students
B. A template to create Objects
C. People living in the middle class : ''')

if quiz1 == 'B' or quiz1 == 'b':
    print('\nAbosolutely Right answer, Sir\n')
else:
    print('\nSorry, Sir. Wrong Answer')

#       'Class' is the template to create similar Objects.
