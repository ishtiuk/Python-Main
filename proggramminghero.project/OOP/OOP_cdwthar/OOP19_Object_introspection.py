# now, Remember onething that Everything in "Python Programming" is remains as an Object like: int type varrible is 'int' Object
#  def is 'function' Object, sting type varrible is 'str' Object etc...

#    so, now what is Object Instrospection?  IT's just a way to Know about any 'Object' in details.... that's it

#   now, let's try Instrospection on the 'Employee' Class ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

# some introspection ways:
# 1. type
# 2. id
# 3. dir

# print(type(Employee))
# print(id(Employee))
# print(dir(Employee))


# import inspect

# print(inspect.getmembers(Employee))

# print(inspect.getmembers(google_employee))
