#   'Abstraction' means to the small part of a Big work or anything, that means it is used to Cut a Big work into small pieces

# for example, there are a Game Developer Software Engineer, they have a Project to make an Open World Game like GTA series games, 

#               ||| Example of 'ABSTRACTION'  ||||

# so, one they will divide the whole work or Project into small pieces , that's called the 'Abstraction', now imagine that they have divided the Project into three peices.
# like as:
# 1. Player
# 2. City
# 3. City Management

# so, one Developer will take one Project, Right? Then, they will complete their own Projects.

# then all Projects will be given to the Main Software Engineer or the Product Manager, 
# then he/ she will Compose the game to make it easily playble or usable to they General People or Gamers.

# because, General People or Gamers should not to know about the codes of the Game, Right? Cause they just want to Play it.



#                  ||| Example of 'Encapsulation' ||||

# now, here the role of the Main Software Engineer or the Product Manager is the 'Encapsulation', 
# because he/ she had Encapsulated or Sorted the whole game for the users.
# he/ she has Assembled the all Projects (Abstracts).. Right?



# so, this is the Encapsulation.......
