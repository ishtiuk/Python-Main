# Your mom might say you are lazy but you do a lot of things.

#       Hard Work 
# Like you sleep 12 hours. That's work ðŸ™‚. Because, laying on the bed is hard?. Even your mom can't do it for 6 hours in a row. 

#           Function
# Also, you know how to code. You can just declare a function to do some tasks. 

#           Declare a Function
# For example, to add two numbers you can declare a function like this.

#           Object Work
# Inside a class, you can have a function. This will give the ability to do some work.

# In fact, every Object created from that class will be able to call that function and perform that task.



#                   Defination of ' Method '

# Those functions created inside a 'class' are called a 'method'. For simplicity, you can think of them as class function.

# However, don't tell this to nerdy programmers. Those unsocial caffeine suckers might laugh at you.


#                   Functions in a class are called methods.
