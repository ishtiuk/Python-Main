# One day your mom said to you- no more ice cream for you.

# After 10 mimnutes, your brother caught you in front of the Refigerator. H

# He asked: What's on your hand?
# you said: Nothing.
# he said: No, you are hiding something. Let me see. 
# you replied: absolutely, nothing. (and put your hands on yur mouth and ran away)

# you both used the 'thing' word. Like nothing, something, anything etc.

# However, have you wonderd what the 'thing' word mean?

# the word 'thing' means stuff or any element / jekono jinis / things, right?

# now, if you look around, you might see chairs, tables, bed, books, cars, clothes, and some animals called Humans.

# '''''''''' Now, what is the "Object" in programmming? """"""
# in a generic sense, you can refer to chairs, tables, as things or objects.....

# That means everything around you could be called an 'Object'.

# In programming, both the living and static things are called Objects.

# That's why your chair is an Object, your book is an Object, Even your mom, dad, your brother, sister, grandfather, nana, nanu, dada, dadu is also an Object.

# In Programming everything is an Object........../////////////////////////////////////
