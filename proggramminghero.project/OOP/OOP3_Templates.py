# When you were a Kid, you had a burning question  -- How are kids made?
# Well, we won't answer that question.

# However, let's talk about how Objects are made.

# let's say you have to Cut 5 pieces of papers in a Circular Shape. What will you do?
# now, you can Draw one Circle on a piece of paper, Then put that paper on top of 5 pieces of paper. Then cut them altogether. 

# This way, you made sure that all the Circles look similar.

# Because they were made by using the exact same 'template'. 


#           Phones

# Now think about all the iPhones or Samsungs. How do all the phones from a company look the same?

# Because while manufacturing, they used the same design, smae specification, same 'template'.

#          Template
# This means while creating Objects in a bulk quantity, manufacturers use the same 'template'.

A. I don't know, I didn't make those
B. They used the same template
C. They are Objects, who care : ''')

# ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
#           Use a 'template' to create similar Objects..............


#              Same Attribute
# Let's look at another example. Every person in the world has a name. You can say, everyone has a name 'Attribute'.
# However, everyone's name is different. This means everyone has the same 'attribute' but the value of their attribute will be different.

#             Phone Number
# Similarly, every Phone has a 'phone_number' or "IMEI number" attribute. but the values of this number associated with a phone is different than the others. Right???? 

#           Cars
# Now, imagine yourself as the CEO of the Toyota car company. You have to produce 1000 'Camry' car. Every car will have the price, brand, VIN (vehicle identifiction number) attributes.

# now, here you have to use 'template' . like , here you have to make sure every car looks the same, you will use a template/ specification/ blueprint.

# This means you will use a 'template' to confirm similar 'attributes' on every car.
#               Similar Attributes

# you will do the same thing while coding.
#
# During coding, you will need a lot of 'Objects' with similar attributes. In those cases, you will use a 'template' to make sure every 'object' has the same 'attributes'.
