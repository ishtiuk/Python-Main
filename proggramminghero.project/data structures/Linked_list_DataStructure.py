# Let's say, you have gone on a Sea-beach with your friends. And you all had grabed the hands of each other and taken a Photo.
# so, you all have made a Human Chain here. 
# that means you all are connected or linked with each other. Right?


#                                               ''' Defination of Linked List '''
# '''' Similarly, a ' Linked List ' is a list of data where all data will be linked to each other. linked data in a list are called " Linked List ".


#                              ''' difference of List and Linked List '''
# In a 'List' every element is independent, in a 'Linked list' element is connected and...
# Each item in a "List" is called an "Element". On the other hand, each item in a "Linked List" is called a "Node".


#                 '''' List VS Linked List ''''
# in  a 'List' every element is independent, on the other hand in a 'Linked List' every element or "nodes " are connected.


#  "''''             about Node      "
# a Node contains two following things:-
# 1. Data or Value.
# 2. A pointer to the next element.                  # here 'pointer' or 'pointers' are used to link elements in a Linked List.


# ''''''''''           Head and Tail '''''''''
# the first Node of a Linked List is called the "   Head " and the last Node of a Linked List is called the "  Tail ". And the rest of the elements are called ' Nodes '.


#    ''''        Add new element or Node steps      ''''''''''
# 1. Start with the Head 
# 2. Walk all the way to the last Node.
# 3. add element or item there.
# 3. Create a link from the last Node or item to the new Node or item.



#      '''' Adding new element in the middle ''''
# 1. Start from the Head
# 2. Find the Node after which you want to add.
# 3. Point the current Node towards the new Node.
# 4. Point the new Node to the Next Node.

# that's it .


#     ''' removing a Node or element '''''
# 1. Start with the Head.
# 2. Keep going to the right and search for the element
# 3. Once you find the element, link the previous element to the next element.
# 4. just point the previous element to the next element.


# overall, all elements will be linked even if you add or remove. remember, Linked List will remain linked always.
