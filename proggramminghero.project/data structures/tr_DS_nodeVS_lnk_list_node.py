# now, at my opinion there are some difference between the 'Tree DS nodes' and the 'Linked List DS nodes'.

# so, that's are:

# in the case of "Linked DS nodes", 
# the nodes contain two kinds of item which are :
#     1. 'value or data'.
#     2. 'pointer to the next node'.



# in the case of "Tree DS nodes",
# the nodes contain also two kinds of item, but they are :
#    1. Data or value
#    2. Child nodes (which are consist under this node)
