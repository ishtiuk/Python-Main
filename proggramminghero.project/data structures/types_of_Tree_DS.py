# There are about 80+ different types of Tree Data Structure ü•¥

# but we'll talk about four Tree DS now: 

#  1. Tree (general kind)( that Data Structure which has root, child node(branchs, leaves) )
#  2. Binary Tree (That special kind of Tree that can have only Two Child Nodes)
#  3. Binary Search Tree.
#  4. Heap. 


# ========= Binary Tree ========= 

    #        A
    #      /   \
    #     D     C
    #    / \   / \
    #   E   F I   L
                    
# A Binary Tree could have maximum of two childern. Hence, in a binary Tree, any given node could have zero, one or two nodes but not more than two ü§ê.
# They cannot have more than two Nodes or Children 



# ========= Binary Search Tree (BST) ============

# 'Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special kind of Binary Tree (BST), it follows Two Rules:

#  1. The value of the Left Child Node will be smaller than the value of Parent Node
#  2. and the value of the Right Child Node will be greater or higher the value of Parent Node.

    #        5
    #      /   \
    #     2     8
    #    / \   / \
    #   1   4 6  11
    #           /  \
    #          9   14




#  ============= Heap ============

# Basically, A 'Heap' is also a special kind of 'Binary Tree'. 

# When the value of any Parent Node is higher or equal to any Child Node, the Tree is called 'Max Heap' üòé

    #        12
    #      /   \
    #     10    8
    #    / \   / 
    #   5   6 2



# and when the value of any Parent Node is lower or equal to any Child Node, the Tree is called 'Min Heap' üòé

    #        2
    #      /   \
    #     3     5
    #    / \   /
