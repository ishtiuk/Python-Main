# Data Structure means a bunch of structured data. When you put data in a structured way, then that's called as a Data Structure. 

# A data sturcture or sturctured data helps you to store, manipulate (use efficiently) and use data in a effective way. 

# So, use data sturcture to store, manipulate and use data.


# ''' List is a Data Structure'''

# but why? because a List follows the rules or properties to be a Data Stucture. Those rules or properties are:

    # 1. Store more than one data   ------------ here a List is able to this, List can contain multiple datas.
    # 2. Special stucture to store data  ------------ here also a List is able to this, because List stores data in a specific way,
    #                                                 like:-    chars = ['df', 'fdf', 1, 8, 65, '|', ',', '.']
    #                                                 here List stores multiple data using comma, which is a specific storing way,
    # 3. Specific rule to add or remove data. ------- here a List also able, because a list has specific rule to add or remove data. Like:
    #                                                 '' chars.append("algo") '', this is used to add data in List. annnd
    #                                                 '' chars.remove("algo") '', this is used to remove data from List.
