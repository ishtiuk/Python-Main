#  A tree has a root, multiple branches, and leaves.
# the main point is here.
# a tree starts with a root, then the root gets divided into multiple branches. And at the end of the branches there are leaves..! Right?

# now, think about a family stucture, Your grandfather have your dad, uncle and aunts
# thus, under your Father, you have yourself and your brothers or sisters or siblings. aaandd Similarly, your uncles and aunties. They have also their sons and daughters.

# now, see a reverse or ulta tree, then you will see that your family structure form your grandpa to your siblings and your uncles aunts childs -- is almost simillar with a reverse or ulta tree.

# so, your family structure is also a Tree Data Structure. 


#           """'     Defination of Tree Data Structure    ''"
# When data is stored in a Tree structure format, then it's called a Tree Data Structure.

#                """ Nodes """
# each element of a Tree Data Structure is called a 'Node'. Hence, in the family tree data structure, 
# your grandpa is a "node", your father, uncles, aunts are 'nodes' and you, your siblings, your cousins are also 'nodes'.

#               "" Root nodes ""
#     annnnnd now, the topmost or staring node is called the 'root' of the tree data structures. And, any node connected under the node is called a 'child node'. 

#             "''' Parent Nodes ''''
# On the other hand, any noce connected on the upward is called a 'parent node' of the or those node under it. 

#               "" Leaves ""
# These nodes that don't have any child node is called the leaves. Like, you and your sibling as you have no childs for now. but remember, when you will have childs then you will also become
# 'Parent Node'...!! and your childs will be the 'Leaves',        interesting, right?



# so, let's see some more examples now............
#  "         Folder Example     "
# hope, you are familliar with Computer folder or directory.
# so, what can you do there? you can make multiple folder under a folder, right?
# if you go inside any Folder/Directory, that folder has a few other folders in it. And on and on. and at last those folders contains some docs, right?

# that means 'folder structure' also maintains the 'Tree Data Structure', so you can call it "folder tree" too.

# "        Power Transmission        "
# now, if you think about the 'electricity', it's generated in the power plants, then the power or electric cables go to different areas.
# aannd, then through a transformer, it gets different lines and then branches out more. Eventually, it gets into the house you live in. 

# This means 'power transmission process' also follows the 'tree data structure'. so, you can name is as ' Power Tree' so...... interesting.....!!

# "       Schoool Tree     "
# if you look into your school or college, you will see headmaster or principal is in the root. And then under headmaster or principal there could be a few departments or few other roles
# being played by somebody. In a department, there are multiple teachers. And under each teacher, there are multiple students. Hence, that means the school system is also "Tree Data Structure", you can call it also 'School Tree'.



# the al things starts from the 'Root' in a 'Tree Data Structure'.
