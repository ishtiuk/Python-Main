# A 'Priority Queue' is a special kind of Queue.

# let's say you are in a waiting line at your school. In a food serving waiting line.

# the school policy is - all students are equal. Hence, the first student stands on the line gets food first. 

# and school policy is - when a teacher comes for food. The teacher will get a 'priority'.

# this means even a teacher comes later, he/ she will get food first. meanwhile, if more than one teachers come. All the teachers will be served first. And then students will be served at first..!

# that means, the teachers got 'priority'. Their queue is a higher priority than student priority........ Right?...!!?


# now, think for a sec that, what will be there if the 'principal' comes to the line. The He/ she will get the utmost priority.


# so, now the defination giving time..........


#            "         Defination of Priority Queue         "
# if a 'queue' is designed in such way to give higher priority to a special type of elements, then that 'queue' is called 'Priority Queue'.

# so, a 'Priority Queue DS' follows the Priority law or principal.
