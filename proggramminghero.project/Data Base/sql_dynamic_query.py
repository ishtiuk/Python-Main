import sqlite3

# we have to execute dynamic queries. 

# like, inside software we'll take user's Email through some input and stored it in a variable called   "user_email".

user_email = input('Tell me about your Email: ')
user_friends = int(input('Tell me about your Friends number: '))

# there are three different ways to to create a Dynamic Query. One bad way is concatenate strings. But it increases the chance of getting Hacked..! ðŸ˜’
# another way is to use Question mark (?) as a placeholder, but it's also less usefull ðŸ™„

# one usefull way is to create a Dictionary>..

# type the full query as we want and just at the place of dynamic value, write a key. (Notice that while typing a 'key' in the query, you have to put a colon before the name
# of the 'key'. 
# 
# Hence, a dictionary key with a colon is the named 'Placeholder'), Like below...
