# let's do it some Wiredly ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´

hash_line = '# # # #'

for i in range(4):

# but it's look like something Wried ðŸ¥´, let's do it with only one 'hash', hassh = '# '

# look at the codes below...

hassh = '# '

for i in range(4):                              # and the first 'for' loop will loop the inner 'for' loop for 4 times.. that means it will print '4 Columns'

    for j in range(4):                          # this 'for' loop will be looped for (0 - 3) times, that means for 4 times) and 'print' '#' for 4 times 'Together'...
        print(hassh, end='')                    # that means, it will print '1 row'.. ðŸ˜Ž
    print()


# and, one more thing, it's a nested 'for' loop.. ðŸ™‚
