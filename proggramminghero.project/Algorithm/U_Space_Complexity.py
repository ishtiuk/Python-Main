# Space Complexity is another criteria to check Algorithm's Efficiency. It is called "Space Complexity "    (we already know about the "Time Complexity ðŸ˜Ž")



# The "Space Complexity" is the extra Memory Space needed by an Algorithm due to change in the input size. 



#   Space Complexity Computing ...

# To compute Space Complexity, we don't need to consider the Input Size (n).



# We just need to consider the Extra Variables or Extra List that created by the Algorithm.... ðŸ™‚

# For Example:

# Like, the Bubble Sorting and Selection Sorting Algorithm we have created 'Temp' Variable, it was made for every Loop and overrided, 

# so, to compute it's 'Space Complexity' we need to consider the 'Temp' variable, that's it. (like how many times it was created and overrided)


#  Space Complexity doesn't depend on how many Loop are creating, rather it depends on How many new Variables or Lists are creating, 




# If you don't create any new array, the Space Complexity will be  'O(1)'  :). |


# If you declare an Array that depends on the input (n). Then the Space Complexity will be " O(n) " :D  ...... ||
