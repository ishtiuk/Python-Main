# 
# now, Imagine that  a Epic has started here among a Tortoise, a Rabbit and Tiger...   and there is a Finish Line at the end of the Race 😎

# now question, which animal can cross the Line at first? Mostly Likely the Tiger, Right? then the Rabbit and then the Tortoise 🙂 

# Although, all the three Animal (Tiger, Rabbit, Tortoise) has the same Start and Finish Line, they won't be Equally Efficient. Right? 😏😏


#         ==========  CODE EFFICIENCY ===========
# The same thing happens for the 'Codes'. Two pieces of code might do the same thing.

# But, one could be faster and another could be Slower as compared to another.. 😎


#        ========== RUN TIME =========

# we know that there are two Characteristics of a good ALGORITHM . One is 'Correctness' and another is 'Efficiency' 


#       ======== Defination of EFFICIENCY =========

# The Efficiency is the measure of the time taken by an ALGORITHM while running the code.. 
# so, Efficiency is measured by the RUNTIME Duration of  a 'CODE'........ 😁😁


#       ======== Defination of TIME COMPLEXITY =========

#   =======   So, the comparison of Time to MEASURE the Efficiency of an Algorithm is called 'Time Complexity' 



#      ==============    Usage of Time Complexity ===================

#   Use the 'Time Complexity' to measure Algorithm Effciency..
