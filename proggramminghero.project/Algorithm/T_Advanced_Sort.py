# we know that the 'Bubble Sorting' and the 'Selection Sorting' Algorithm's Time Complexity = O(n ^ 2) 😎
# that's why the both Algorithm uses Nested loop 😎



#  ===============  Best Case  ==============

# if you give a sorted list that means a ascending array to a Sorting Algorithm. 
# then, The Algorithm should be very happy.🤩 It got the easiest job to sort a sorted list 😁


# The performance of a sorting Algorithm while sorting a sorted or ascending List is called the | "Best Case" | Performance. :)

# here, common sense as the sorted List already ascending list, so the Algorithm should not work much to sort this, Righ? That's why, it will be happy 🤩🤩k




# ============== Worst Case  ================

# Now, it's opposite of first one, 🥴 

# If you give a descending sorted List to a Sorting Algorithm , then Algorithm will be sad 😏,
# that's why, it should work more here 🙄


# The performance of a sorting Algorithm while sorting a descending List is called the  | "Worst Case" | Performance . :(







    # There are some 'Advanced Sorting':

    # There are a few advanced sorting algorithms you should google and learn. At least you should know their names.
    # 1. Merge Sort
    # 2. Quich Sort
    # 3. Heap Sort




    # and one more thing :)

    # every Programming Language provides a By-default build-in sort ..........

    # Python provides too...... look at below.....

arry = [44, 45, 768, 673, 8733, 3443]

arry.sort()                 # here we can pass reverse parameter.... 
print(arry)                 # explore own...



# and another as Bonus :)........

print(sorted(arry))
