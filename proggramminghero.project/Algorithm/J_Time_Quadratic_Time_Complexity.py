#  To measuring Time Complexity... you need Two thing:

# 1. Input Size = n
# 2. Growth Rate = O


# here are a 'Nested for Loop' below....

                                                        # For 1 class, you run 'n' students

                                                        # For 'n' class, you run 'n * n' students


                                                        # Now, n X n could be written as 'ùëõ2', Right? 


# So, the Time Complexity of a 'nested Loop is':  O(ùëõ2)


# it's read as 'ooh an square' üòé
