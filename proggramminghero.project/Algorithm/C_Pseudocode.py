#  Before writing the actual code with a Programming Language, a Lot of people write the steps in English or (Natural Language). 😏😏


# These steps might look similar to code but they are not executable codes. They are called 'Pseudocode' 😎😎



#  meaning: 

# The word 'pseudo' means 'not real'.

# Hence, a 'pseudocode' is not a real code. Instead, it's the concept of the code to help a Programmer think about steps. 🙂🙂
