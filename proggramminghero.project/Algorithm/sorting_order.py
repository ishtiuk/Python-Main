#                  Ascending Sort 

# If the elements of a List is sorted from smaller to larger, the List is called a Ascending Sorted List. Look at below>>>>>>>

ascending_sort = [3, 6, 7, 9, 10]



#                 Descending Sort

#                 Build in Sort 

# Every programming language provides a build in sort. You should also know those. 

# Python also provides this, like below...

array1 = [99, 45, 47, 1, 22, 34, 97]

array1.sort()
print(array1)
