# To become a good Algorithm. The Algorithm has to have two Qualities:

#  1. Correctness.
#  2. Efficiency.


# for example, you have muliple ways to go to your school. But you uses specifically one Way. Right? 

# Correctness.
# If you find a shorter way but that doesn't take you to the school, then it's not a good route or Algorithm. 🥴🥴
# Hence, your Algorithm has to Solve the Problem. 😏😏

# Efficiency.
# Your 'Algorithm' should be faster or Efficient than other Alternatives. 

# like, if your school's way goes to the Market. Then it's not a Good Way or Algorithm .



# so, A Good Algorithm should have Correctness and Efficiency... 😎😎
