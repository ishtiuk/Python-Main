#
#  To measure the 'Time Complexity', will need 2 things  . ðŸ˜Ž

# 1. The Input Size.   =  'n'
# 2. The growth Rate   =  'O'

# if you have to Search any element from any List, you will obiously run a For loop 
# and check the first Element and will keep going all the Way towards the last Element, Right...?? 


# now Check Check and Check ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´ 

# If the List has 10 Elements, you have to check 10 times
# If the List has 20 Elements, then you have to check 20 times
# And if the List has 1000 Elements, then you have to check 1000 times ðŸ¥´ 

# Or simply if the Array or List has 'n' number of Elements, you have to Check 'n' times... ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´


#  === Linear ===
# Now, if you increase one Element in the List, you have to check one more Element, Right?
# Thus, if you increase or add 10 more Elements then you have to check 10 more Elements... ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
