#
# Python has a function called range. It provides a range of Numbers. (Hence, we already know this ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´)

# If you want to have 5 numbers from 0. You will write code like this:-

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# it will be stop at 5, Hence, you will see numbers from 0 to 7 


print()
#   =======   By Default ========

# By default, the range will start from 0. However, 
# if you want the range start from another number other than 0, you will pass two parameter to the range function like below.

for i in range(5, 9):
    print(i)



# now, if you write 'range(1, n)', your range will start from 1 and will stop at 'n'. Hence, you will see the numbers from '1 to n - 1'





#    so, the 'range' function creates a range of numbers.. ðŸ˜Ž, but we already know this ..... ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´
