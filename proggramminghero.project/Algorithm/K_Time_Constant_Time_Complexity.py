# now, if you exactly know that where is your phone's charger. Maybe in the Drawing Room under the chair. 


# so, you don't need to search that one by one or crazly whole house, Right?
# you will simply go to the Drawing Room and grab the Phone's charge under of the Chair. Easy...!!



# Similarly, if you know the index of an Element of a List. Then you don't need to Loop through the List. 
# Instead you can directly access the Element by it's Index.... Like below..

# suppose you know 5 's index which is 3 index number. So you will directly access 5 from the List ðŸ˜Ž

lst = [7, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4]

search = 5

print(lst[3])           # here Time Complexity = O * 1 = O(1)


# it wiil read as 'Ooh one' ðŸ˜Žd



#  HEre, For direct access, it will take exactly the
# 'O' growth rate time = 1 second (we have considered "O" = 1 second constantly for the previous 2 Algorithm's Time Complexity the (Linear Complexity & Binary Complexity ðŸ™‚))

# so, here the input size 'n' doesn't matter, because here we are accessing directly by Index ðŸ˜Ž, so here it will take only 1 second which is 'O' GROWTH RATE ....




# Similar to a List, if you have a Dictionary. You can access any pair by using a key. 
# You won't have a loop through the whole Dictionary.


# Any you will have O(1) or constant Time Complexity...
