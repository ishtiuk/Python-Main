# now, let's say 'second' became angry and he wants to go at 'first', so what can you do now?

# here, you need to declare a temporary variable. Because if you just set the variable 'second' as the value of the first variable, 
# then the value of the 'first' variable will be lost.


first = 'V'
second = 'Silverhand'

temp = first                        # remember, while we have to swap to elements or varribles or whatever.........
first = second                      # the first thing, we have to store the first elemen into a 'temp' varrible :-/
second = temp                       # then, declare the first element to get the value of second element.
                                    # and then, declare the second element to get the value of 'temp' element, (which is the value of ex-'first element' :)

print(first, second)

# so, use a 'temp' variable to swap Two variables.. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
